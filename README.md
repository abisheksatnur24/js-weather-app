# js-weather-app
A weather app that uses API calls to openweathermap.com to display real time weather.

Concepts practiced: 
* CSS flexbox
* Background image updates in real time via an API call that includes the city the user searches for.
* Promises using the fetch API, which was used to fetch the weather of the city the user searches for.
* Updating the front end based off the fetch API call's data using document query selection.
